        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">Java Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">As part of my 3rd year college studies in spring 2023, I began learning Java. This was a challenge since objects and classes are such a big foundation of many languages that I would learn going forward. In the next semester, fall 2023, I met another girl...and I continued programming. That class build off the previous Java class and went into special data structures. I did quite a few interesting things with Java, however the usefulness decreased when I learned deeper technologies in the C# language.

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Call of Duty: Zombies Mystery Box Simulation</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This was a project undertaken during the spring 2023 semester of which I was in my Java class having just learned very basic python. I used this to simulate the odds of getting the Baby Gun of the Call of Duty: Zombies map, 'Shangri-la'.

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Cypher Algorithm</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">After the previous project in Java, I hit a cryptographic phase. I made quite a few programs both in python and java that dealt with ciphers. This was an extension of that, note that I had been doing these programs since the very first programming video ever posted to the channel (a python video).

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Pokemon Battle Program</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This was around a week after the Cypher Algorithm project, I created this just to see how feasible replicating turn-based games in Java would be. As far as programs go, this one is very simple and there is not much to talk about. Perhaps this is a project that should be remastered in another language with more complexity?

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="MatrixClass">Matrix and Vector Classes in Java</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This is a year after the last Java program. I am in a Linear Algebra class learning about some crazy stuff like matrix determinants, reduced-row echelon form, and inverting matrices. So I did what I always do and got to work. just about anytime a new concept was introduced in class I was there getting it done! Matrix addition, done! Matrix Gaussian Reduction, done! Matrix Determinants done with recursion, done! This also served as a foundation for a project undertaken in C# later in that semester.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="JavaDBMS">Fridge Database System</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This is fall 2024, I have just programmed a python and a c# database system and wanted to try it in Java. So what did I do? I got to googling and found the resources I needed and got down to business. I was inspired by tracking what was in my fridge as I seemed to blow through my stores of Mtn Dew at an alarming rate (maybe like 40-60 cans in a month?). So this program handled that issue, though I never used it because I can see inside my fridge...It was certainly cool to see that there was a technology like databases that could be done in Java like this since Java was slowly fading away since nothing new was introduced since I met that girl in fall 2023.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="JavaSprintBoot_1">Electric Marimba Company -- Sprint Boot</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This is fall 2025, I am getting closer to graduating from college and I had applied for a summer internship. A classmate who was working there told me that learning Sprint Boot + Docker would be a good thing, so I did. This project utilized my passion for percussion and my newfound skills for web development. I hadn't done a Java program in half a year (not including school-work that is). Learning Docker was the harder of the two items I learnt since the Spring Boot stuff is similar to Django and Blazor.
