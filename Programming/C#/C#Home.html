        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">C# Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">As part of my 3rd year college studies in spring 2024, I began learning different technologies in c#, some of these included databases, networking, and websites. Some of the following are inspired from what I learned, and some of it I learned on my own.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="CSharpDBMS">Population Model Database</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Towards the end of my spring 2024 semester, I created a population model using a SQLite database to simulate how a population may change over time. This was not too deep as the mechanic to bring more people into the population was a simple cooldown based on how long a woman had been alive within the population. Death could occur at random so the tendency was for the population to wittle away and go extinct within a few generations.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="MatrixWebsite">Matrix Website</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">About a month after the population model database, I used some of the knowledge I gained during that semester to create a website that performs many operations such as addition, multiplication, inversion, and rref of matrices. Much of this logic was converted from a Java program I had been writing throughout that semester inspired by my Linear Algebra class.

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Player Playlist Executable</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">During the summer after the matrix website project, I created a song playlist executable. You add the .wav files to the directory, and you can play them from the app. This was the first time I created an executable from my programs and was able to give it to another person to run outside an IDE.

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Resultant Vector Executables (V1 & V2)</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">In spring 2025, I had a physics class in college. We were going over how to calculate resultant vectors, I already knew how to so instead I decided to program and create and executable to do it for me. The first version had a couple of flaws that would be fixed with the creation of the second version.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="FileSharingDBMS">File Sharing Database Server</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Not too long after the two physics executables, inspired by the computer networking class, I created a database of files and directories that could be shared over a network. This was only ever tested on my localhost, but I was able to send several files and entire directories to another folder. This used json serialization to ensure the contents are in the same format on reception as sent.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="WinFormsAndWPF_1">WinForms & WPF</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">At the end of the spring 2025 semester, I got a job working as a remote programmer/software engineer. My boss informed me to learn WinForms then WPF since I would be using them for the job. These were the two projects that were born from me learning those two technologies.
