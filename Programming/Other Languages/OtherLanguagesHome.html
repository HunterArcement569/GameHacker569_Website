        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">C++ Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">I taught myself C++ right after the spring 2023 semester ended, but did not use it very much until C++ class, and not much since then. Most of what I can do in Java I should (theoretically) be able to do in C++.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Periodic Table Database Retrieval</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This was one of the first programs I wrote in C++, I had no idea of what real databases were and so this was my closest approximation. So this ended up being just a showcase of how many 'if - else if' statements a man can make before going insane. Don't believe me? Just you wait and see, all will become clear once you've seen <a href="../../Programming/Python/PythonHome.html#MonopolyWithPython" class="InWebsiteLink">Monopoly with Python!</a>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Gravitational Pull Calculator</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Also one of the first programs I wrote in C++, I had no idea about the integer bit limit and was forced to confront it head on in this program, by head on I mean shy away and only use small numbers in examples...

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Quadratic Formula Solver</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Flash forward maybe one summer, and I am in some algebra class. Yay me...Anyways, I created this tool because math is boring without programming it to understand thoroughly. It became something I said alot to myself, "if you understand a math concept enough to program it, then you understand it enough to pass the exam!". And so, I ended up with this and an acceptable score of a C in math that semester.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="CppDBMS">Zombies High Rounds Database System</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Ok, so I am in my database phase, I decided to hit C++ after doing Java. This took longer than C since this was where I learned the classes and techniques to perform database operations. It really did not help that I avoided C++ programming like the plaque ever since the C++ class ended. What can I say? C++ was never my favorite language (yes, I spell 'favorite' without the 'u', sorry if that hurts your feelings!

        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">C Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">I taught myself C at the start of the spring 2025 semester. So I haven't known it long, despite that I have already used in two database projects (one for school, I don't post school projects to Youtube as the projects tend to be CopyRighted by the teachers).
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="CDBMS">Car Database Management System</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">It is partway through the spring 2025 semester, I just taught myself basic C. "Let's do a DBMS for fun!" I said. So it was that I got to it, very quickly I picked up that the syntax and even the functions used in database operations for SQLite in C are very similar to C++ (which I had done a couple of months beforehand). I breezed through this and was quite proud that I had managed to solve some of the challenges like the lack of true classes and lack of dynamically sized arrays.

        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">Rust Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">I taught myself Rust partway through fall 2024 semester. I have not done very much with it, mostly contained to a single database project. I do wish to use it more, however my focus has since shifted away from it, and there aren't many projects that I can do in Rust that would be easier or more practical in another language.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">First Two Rust Programs</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">These were the two first programs I wrote in Rust, rather beginner level stuff. Frankly as a starting point these are where most languages I learned started from. Nothing wrong with that since having a good foundation is important, however one thing I'd do differently if I could go back in time and do so: I would read more on Rust's unique Ownership memory system as it would've seriously sped up the learning time for the basics.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="RustDBMS">Music Database System</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">As I entered my database phase in the fall 2024 semester, and had just learned rust halfway through that semester. I thought I'd add rust to the list of languages I could do database programs in...It took me three months of research to get the resources needed to get programming. By that point it was Christmas break, however like the programming nerd I am, I did this program and am proud of the result. I haven't used rust at all since and so I doubt I could do better now, plus I don't have any ideas of what other things I can learn and do with the Rust programming language.

        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">PHP Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">I taught myself PHP partway through summer 2024. I have not done very much with it, mostly contained to a single database project and some light-work in conjunction with html/css. I will use it more as I proceed deeper down the rabbit-hole of web design and development.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">First PHP Project</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This was me learning php because I was told I would need it in the Database Management Systems class I'd be taking the next semester. Instead of waiting to be taught, I hopped in, got the IDE and taught myself what I needed to know. This first project was the result of that. Though php is soon to be relegated to web development backend strictly since that is what it is best suited for.

        <p class="ProjectDescription">Once again we do this project? Ugh, fine lets do it again shall we? Not even a month fully passed after the last php project (above), I decided to rehash a project that I had done about a single handful of times. I hope ya'll weren't bored by this one. There really wasn't anything changed in how it worked, it's just a different language...scary right?

        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">JavaScript Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">I taught myself JavaScript partway through fall 2024 semester. I have not done very much with it, mostly contained to a single database project and some light-work in conjunction with html/css. I will use it more as I proceed deeper down the rabbit-hole of web design and development. There is likely some JavaScript in this website and within the personal professional website (possibly linked to this one, but will not be covered in a Youtube video).
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="ProjectName"  id="MatchMakingInJavaScript">Matchmaking Database System</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">It's in the middle of the spring 2025 semester, I am still single and trying to do databasing with JavaScript. I had been trying to do this project for months to no progress. Getting the resources was the first hurdle, the second was the weird syntax of needing to wrap all database functions in promises. I ended up relying on ChatGPT for the first time ever because of this project. Although the majority of the programming was my own, the basic syntax of how to use a database operation I had to ask ChatGPT to show me. Frankly if I tried this again, I'd have to rely on this program as a template to make it work at all. Yeah, this ended up being that complicated syntactically. The python assembler and the assembly database program was actually easier than this. let that soak in for a minute -- a language wihthout database support was easier to program databases in than JavaScript...just had to vent there, sorry!

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="GameHacker569Website">YouTube Website</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">It's in the middle of summer 2025, I had been desiring to enhance my web development skills (in particular HTML, CSS, & JS). To accomplish this, I bought two books: One for beginners in HTML, CSS, & JS -- and another for professional web developers in JS. This project (which is the website you are on now!) was born as a way to practice and fully learn what I was reading, and bridge into a larger project. That project (my personal LinkedIn website) will not be on Youtube as a video, however you may view it through the link to my LinkedIn in the footer of each page in this site). I really enjoyed learning about css transitions and gradients. This biggest thing I wish I got to do more of for this project was use more JavaScript. There is a single function and one feature that uses it, the random video generator on the home (index.html) page.
