        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">Unity Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">After my spring 2023 semester, I learned Java in class, then C# and C++ on my own right before summer. Then, I began teaching myself Unity during the summer, starting with 2D games and applications. Eventually, after a game development class in college, began posting 3D games. There are quite a few ambitious projects that are in various staged of brainstorming behind the scenes, though game development takes time, and they are very far off from hitting Youtube, let alone the market.

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Flappy Bird Recreation</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This is during the summer in 2023, I am teaching myself Game Development using the Unity Game Engine. This was done using a tutorial on Youtube and some assets from my sister. This taught me many of the basics and as far as a starting point, many of the projects I would go on to work on both for fun and in the two game development classes I have taken in college, it was a fair foundation.

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Rust Raid Calculator</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This project was one at some point when I worked at Little Caesars. My boss got me to play this game <i>Rust: Console Edition</i>. I wanted to learn it fast and be an asset to our small group, so I created this application to help with raiding. Raiding is the act of either picking through or blowing through the base of another player or group of players to take their loot and evict them. The stats are not correct anymore (honestly the wiki's stats were weird, so they may have never been correct). But this also proved the merit of web applications through Unity at a time where all of my other projects were constrained to console applications.

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="UnityBirthday">Birthday Analysis</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">The Rust project above led me to recreating the birthday analysis program from python with Unity's UI. Overall, the project turned out fine, though it has a limit of 50 birthdays in storage compared to the limit of the size of a .txt file for the python variant. Frankly if I did this today, I would use several .json files to ensure speend and storage, or use a SQLite database outright. The coding behind was messy and with those small changes plus using prefabs, I could probably cut the code complexity by 50% and make it look better while I am at it!

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Random 3D Maze</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">As my first 3D game, this was a prototype to see how far I could push my own personal game development. Many of the challenges I dealth with working on this improved my knowledge of game development. Some of these included the maze generation algorithms, memory (RAM) usage, animations, and effects. Much of what I learned here went into the game development projects, as I finished this at some point during a semester where I was taking one of the two game development courses in uni.
