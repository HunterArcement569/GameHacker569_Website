        <h1 class="ProjectHeader">Python Projects</h1>
        <p class="ProjectHeaderParagraph">As part of my 2nd year college studies in fall 2022, I began learning programming. This started with python, a very simple programming language with many avenues and uses --many of which are showcased through the significantly longer playlist on the channel.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Triangle Solver</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">At some point during the semester that I began learning python in, I had a trigonometry test coming up.This inspired me as I had recently learned about the math functions in python and set out with my new knowledge to create a tool to solve triangles given three pieces of information. The program can either use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines to solve the triangle depending on the information it is fed. For one of my first programs that had a real use, I was quite proud of it back then. Perhaps one day a more refined version in another language will hit the channel?

        <h2 class="ProjectName">How to Ask a Girl Out With Code</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Not too long (about 3 days) after the Triangle solver, I met a girl that I crushed on in a Biology class. She isn't relevant aside from being the inspiration for this project -- A literal representation of how to ask a girl out. As someone who was quite shy (at the time) around women, this was a manifestation of that. As one of my most viewed videos on the channel, it certainly brings a smile to my face realizing just how simple of a program it really was. Eventually I went in with JavaScript Databases and made a <a href="../../Programming/Other%20Languages/OtherLanguagesHome.html#MatchMakingInJavaScript" class="InWebsiteLink">matchmaking program</a> as a nod to this very video. I even reference it in the introduction (as a gag)!</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Data Analysis - Birthdays</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This is in the next semester after the lat three projects, that girl has ghosted me, and I was eager to continue programming. I used the newly acquired File IO (input/output) skills to create a program that tracked the ages of people given their birthdays in a file. This project would eventually lead into a fascination and almost knack for databasing. It has been recreated in so many formats even in a <a href="../../Programming/Unity/UnityHome.html#UnityBirthday" class="InWebsiteLink">Unity Application</a>, however this humble python program is the original!</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Checkers (Parts I & II)</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">A month after the last project, I posted two videos: Checkers Parts 1 and 2. I used turtle graphics to recreate checkers which at the time was impressive considering I did not really use many functions so the code ended up being a long 18,000 line affair. As an aspiring game developer this was just the start of recreating games with python without using the pygame or similar modules. Overall this feat gave me more confidence to push forward learning programming, especially at a time where learning Objects & Classes in Java was blowing my mind.</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Chess</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Now we are getting to the big projects, fast-forward from the last project. I have done a few more and now it is summertime, finished my first Java class, and learned C++ and C# on my own. What do I do? Hang out with friends, hahaha don't make me laugh. I made Chess in 48,000 lines of code instead! Similar to checkers I did not use any pygame or similar modules, drawing everything with the turtle graphics module. This was also my first time using Objects and Classes in python, which really validated their usefulness to me. This led me to set my bar even higher after achieving this feat: Monopoly.</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="MonopolyWithPython">Monopoly</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">This is now over a year later, I am in C++/Mips Assembly class and this was posted before starting Mips. The reason this took so long is I ended up mostly restarting after deciding that using objects and classes would speed development and make the code more readable. Though now looking back, still not readable, impressive for sure. Clocking in as, to this day, my largest (by lines of code) project with 98,000 lines of code. I really gave my self wrist pain for a few days over this. Once again not using pygame or similar modules and drawing everything through turtle graphics.</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Battleship</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">It has been a month since Monopoly released. I want to make a smaller program instead of a larger one, so as my last board game creation project, I selected Battleship. using objects and classes this project was finished in record time and with 3,000 lines of code! At this point I was doing crazy stuff in class like databases, networking, and brief introduction to web development through the C# Razor/Blazor tools. Consider that a precursor to creating this website, my personal website, and several WPF programs for my job as a remote programmer/software engineer.</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectName" id="PythonDBMS">Overwatch Map Win Percentage Tracker</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">Zip past the summer, and now I am in a cyber-security introduction course learning about SQL injections. I wanted to learn to do them and defend against them, so what do I do? Like any normal person, I boot up the IDE and google and began programming. While this was not my first run-in with databases (C# gets that honor from the previous semester), it was my first time using real SQL. I may not have gotten SQLi's (SQL injections) to work then, but I certainly made a cool tool for my Overwatch playing experience (though I haven't actually used it since I am usually so focused on the game to log the results).</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectName">Custom MIPS Assembler</h2>
        <p class="ProjectDescription">As of creating this website, my most recent python project, and likely my most ambitious 'for-fun' project. At this point I had done a database related project in <a href="PythonHome.html#PythonDBMS"  class="InWebsiteLink">Python</a>, <a href="../../Programming/Java/JavaHome.html#JavaDBMS" class="InWebsiteLink">Java</a>, <a href="../../Programming/C%23/C%23Home.html#CSharpDBMS" class="InWebsiteLink">C#</a>, <a href="../../Programming/Other%20Languages/OtherLanguagesHome.html#CppDBMS" class="InWebsiteLink">C++</a>, <a href="../../Programming/Other%20Languages/OtherLanguagesHome.html#CDBMS" class="InWebsiteLink">C</a>, <a href="../../Programming/Other%20Languages/OtherLanguagesHome.html#RustDBMS" class="InWebsiteLink">Rust</a>, <a href="../../Programming/Other%20Languages/OtherLanguagesHome.html#PhpDBMS" class="InWebsiteLink">PHP</a>, <a href="../../Programming/Other%20Languages/OtherLanguagesHome.html#MatchMakingInJavaScript" class="InWebsiteLink">JavaScript</a>, and Haskell (never shown since I am still learning the language overall). But there were no database tools in Assembly. So as a clinically insane programmer, what did I do? I made a python program to take all my assembly programs and run them just like my Asm IDE (MARS), then add custom instructions for database operations and make an assembly program to utilize them. Cool part is, this one took a little over 3,00 lines of python code to achieve. The video ended up being nearly an hour long as I wanted to show off all the assembly programs I wrote in a previous semester working through it, as well as the custom program I wrote to do databasing. I am extremely proud of this program, and it certainly blew a lot of my classmates' minds!</p>
